This repository contains Python programs created to complete the assigned programming problems. Each program is saved as a separate Python file and was written, tested, and uploaded individually.

## Description
The files in this repository demonstrate basic Python programming skills, including user input, output, conditional statements, and simple calculations. Each program solves a specific problem and includes comments explaining what the program does.

## Programs Included
- **hello_world.py** – Displays a basic Hello World message  
- **greeting_by_name.py** – Prompts the user for their name and displays a greeting  
- **restricted_greeting.py** – Uses conditional logic to greet only specific users  
- **circle_area.py** – Calculates the area of a circle based on user input  
- **mpg_calculator.py** – Calculates miles per gallon using miles driven and gallons used  
- **fahrenheit_to_celsius.py** – Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius  
- **return_day_calculator.py** – Displays a day of the week based on a number entered by the user  

## Notes
All programs were tested in IDLE before being uploaded. File names were chosen to clearly reflect the purpose of each program.
